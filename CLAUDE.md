# CoreForge — working notes

## Time

**Report all times in Mountain time, never UTC.** Use the offset actually in
effect on the date in question — MDT (UTC−6) during daylight saving, MST
(UTC−7) otherwise — so timestamps match the clock on the wall.

GitHub and CI report UTC. Convert before quoting anything back:

```
TZ=America/Denver date -d "<utc-timestamp>" '+%Y-%m-%d %I:%M %p %Z'
```

This matters more than it looks: UTC late-evening timestamps land on the
*following* date, so an unconverted "deployed 05:39 on Aug 7" is really
"11:39 PM on Aug 6" — a day off.

## What this is

A single-file offline PWA. A ~54-week military-themed calisthenics and core
program, plus nutrition, progress tracking and a guided workout player.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The entire app — markup, styles, and one inline `<script>` |
| `sw.js` | Service worker; `CACHE` name + the full asset `SHELL` |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | PWA metadata |
| `ex-*.jpg`, `wu-*.jpg`, `cd-*.jpg` | Exercise artwork, 800×800 progressive JPEG |

Deployed to GitHub Pages from `main`.

## Conventions that are not optional

**Bump `APP_VERSION` (`index.html`) and `CACHE` (`sw.js`, `coreforge-vNN`) in
lockstep on every ship.** They are the update mechanism. Out of step means
phones either never see the new version or serve a stale cache against new
code.

**Views never clear `innerHTML`.** `go(tab)` toggles `.active` only. Every
view stays mounted. Clearing and re-rendering produced a long-running class of
duplicate-ID bugs where a stale element shadowed the live one.

**API keys live only on the device.** `settings.azureKey` and
`settings.foodAiKey` are stripped by `exportData()` and must never be
committed, logged, or written into a backup file.

**Safety-relevant predicates fail closed.** `safeMode()`, `parqFlags()`,
`dietOk()`, `swapStillValid()`, `offerable()` — when the check itself throws
or the data is the wrong shape, the answer is "not safe / not allowed", never
"fine". An unanswered health screen is not the same as a clean one.

**Every field added to `STATE` gets type repair in `normalizeState()`.** A
non-array where an array was expected has bricked the app (`limitations`),
silently disabled allergen filtering (`allergens`), and unlocked a maximal
test battery for someone with a declared heart condition (`parq`). The render
error boundary retries *through* `normalizeState()`, so anything it does not
repair cannot be recovered from.

**Escape every user-controlled string that reaches `innerHTML`** with `_ve()`
— `profile.name`, `baseline.level`, food names, favourite names. `importData()`
accepts arbitrary JSON, so these are a real injection path, not self-XSS.

## The exercise engine

`EX` holds ~151 exercises. `LADDERS` orders them as progressions. `prescribe()`
turns a rung plus a position into sets, target, rest and tempo.

**`hardness` means: what fraction of your anchor-test max one working set of
this movement is. Higher = easier.** A push-up anchored to the push-up test is
`1.0`; a one-arm variant is far below it. Adding an `anchor` without setting a
calibrated `hardness` makes the engine treat that movement as exactly as hard
as the test itself — that shipped once and prescribed 4×40 dips.

**`LADDERS` arrays must be non-increasing in `hardness`.** A rung that climbs
must never get easier.

## Editing `EX` and the swap maps

These are large hand-maintained object literals, and **regex edits over them
have repeatedly caused real defects**:

- Substring matches: `pistol` matched inside `boxpistol`, `vup` inside
  `tuckvup`, writing one exercise's data onto another's.
- Duplicate keys in a literal are silent — JS keeps the last one. That is how
  `boxpistol:{repCap:12,repCap:10,…}` shipped, and how a shadowed `SAFE_SWAP`
  entry routed a flagged low back into loaded lumbar flexion.

Always anchor to the start of a definition line:

```python
re.match(r"\s{2}([a-z0-9]+):\{", line)
```

…and check the key is the one you meant before substituting.

## `validateData()`

Runs at boot and logs to the console. It checks anchors resolve, anchor units
match the exercise's unit, `base` fits within `repCap`, gear exercises carry a
`pattern`, ladders are monotonic in `hardness`, and every swap target exists.

**Keep it at zero problems.** It caught 14 real defects on its first run that
reading the diff had missed. If a change makes it complain, the change is
wrong — not the validator.

## Shipping

Develop on `claude/abs-core-workout-app-3rr2ob`.

1. Extract the inline script and `node --check` it.
2. Run the suites in the session scratchpad (`board3`, `board`, `board2`,
   `algtest`, `audit`, `wiz7`, `newex`, `todaytabs`) — all green, zero page
   errors, validator clean.
3. Bump `APP_VERSION` and `CACHE` together.
4. `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B <branch> origin/main`, commit,
   push with `--force-with-lease`.
5. Draft PR → ready → confirm `mergeable_state: "clean"` → squash merge.
6. Sync `main`, then confirm the **`Deploy to GitHub Pages`** run for the merge
   commit has BOTH jobs green — `test / test` and `deploy`. The `deploy` job is
   `needs: test`, so a red suite on `main` shows up as *deploy skipped*, not as
   a failure: the version ships nowhere and nothing says so. Check the jobs, not
   just the run.

   There is only one workflow to check now. `pages build and deployment` was the
   branch builder and stopped running when Pages Source moved to GitHub Actions.

**`github.io` is not reachable from this sandbox** — the agent proxy returns
`CONNECT tunnel failed, 403`, so a `curl` poll against the live site never
succeeds and an `until` loop on one spins forever. Confirm a deploy through the
Actions API instead.

Never put a model identifier in a commit, PR, code comment, or anything else
pushed to the repository.
