/* Hardening: the findings from the four-way senior audit that followed seven
   consecutive real-device failures of the screenshot import.

   The complaint that started it was fair — a green suite had been reported as
   "clean and ready" while a headline feature broke on first use. So every check
   in this file is written against the OBSERVABLE effect, not the instruction
   that produces it: an injected element is queried for rather than a substring
   scanned, a habit tick is read back off STATE rather than inferred from the
   function returning, and the calorie button is read for the number it actually
   promises rather than for the fact that a button exists.

   Each block builds the state it asserts on. Nothing here relies on what the
   block above left mounted. */

     A restored backup carries photos verbatim; normalizeState() only ever

     the removeMeasure() defect CLAUDE.md records as fixed in v240, unfixed one
     function away.

     Escaping alone cannot be asserted on: the browser HTML-DECODES an inline

     before it runs. The only check that proves anything injects the rendered

  /* ---------- 10b. the harness must not hand back a covered page -----------
     The check above failed one CI run in three with `hit: "sgrad"` — the
     SPLASH's own gradient. `.splash` is a full-screen `z-index:400` overlay
     dismissed 850ms after the first draw, and waitForBoot resolved on a
     rendered view at about 626ms, so it returned a page with an opaque sheet
     over the whole app and called it booted.

     Nothing that reads TEXT could tell, which is why it survived so long — but
     every check that hit-tests, clicks or screenshots was racing a timer it did
     not know about, and an unrelated change shifting the timing by a few
     milliseconds is all it took to lose. Fixing it inside the one check that
     noticed would have left the class alive, so waitForBoot waits for it.

     MEASURED AT THE MOMENT BOOT RESOLVES, on a fresh load. The first version of
     this block sat where the failure happened, four seconds in — by which time
     the splash is gone whatever waitForBoot does, so the mutant that deletes
     the wait walked straight through it. A check that cannot fire in the case
